This plugin is developed for MRI-to-Histology or Histology-to-MRI transformation
of regions of interest. 

Initially, two 2D images (MRI and histological) should be opened in Imagej,
and regions of interest and linear dimensions of objects (slices)
should be defined in ROI manager. 
Big Warp tool is used for co-registration of MR and histological images.
